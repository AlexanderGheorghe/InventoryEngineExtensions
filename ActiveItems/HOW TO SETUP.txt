A demo Unity scene is in the root folder.
Open it to have an example to see how it works.

I assume you have a basic knowledge about making a simple Item inside the Inventory Engine.

You have only one item in this inventory. If you pick another active item with this script it will drop the current held item and pick the new one instead.


> Create a new Main Inventory 
> Put the ActiveItemPicker script found in Script/ on the itemPicker of the item you want to set as "active" (as in "The Binding of Isaac" for example, you can only have one card, and/or one active item).
	// You'll want to tick the 3 boxes in the picker script, at least the 2 first ones.
> Don't forget to redirect your items to the active items inventory in your item scriptable object.

NOTE : If you have trouble picking your item, change it's drop properties for it to spawn farther.


I suppose if you want more items in this inventory you could :
	1_ increase the slots
	2_ have a reference of the first and last slot
	3_ drop the first item in this inventory, move all active items you have (the 2nd becomes the 1st, 3rd becomes the 2nd...) to pick a new one in the now-empty last slot.


Have fun making your game !
